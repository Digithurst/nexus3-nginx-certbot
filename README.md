# Nexus 3 with SSL through nginx+certbot on docker-compose

`init-letsencrypt.sh` fetches and ensures the renewal of a Letâ€™s
Encrypt certificate for one or multiple domains in a docker-compose
setup of Nexus 3 with an nginx proxy.

## Installation

2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Digithurst/nexus3-nginx-certbot.git .`

3. Modify configuration:
- Add domains and email addresses to init-letsencrypt.sh

```
chmod +x ./init-letsencrypt.sh
./init-letsencrypt.sh
```
